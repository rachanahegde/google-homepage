<h1> google homepage </h1>

This is a project for The Odin Project's Web Dev 101 course. This is the easy version of the project which involves deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. There was a steep learning curve but now I have a better understanding of HTML and CSS. 

<h2> reflections on the process </h2>

Doing this project forced me to finally figure out how to use the browser's developer tools. These were especially useful when I needed to figure out the exact shade of blue or grey that Google uses and for other little things that made the page look more realistic. I also learned how to run Git commands on my laptop and update this repo.

Building the navigation bar was a little more difficult than I expected because I had to figure out how to get the spacing, padding, margins right. This was an issue I ran into a lot while building the rest of the page. This design also isn't responsive so resizing the browser window sometimes had a weird effect on the spacing of all the elements. 

Building the search bar taught me how to nest divs. I spent a few hours working this out because I had never done this before and positioning the elements correctly was difficult. I also had to be careful about which aspects of the div that I targetted with my CSS because sometimes it would unintentionally affect another element positioned nearby. 
**Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page**
I also learned about box shadows and how to add that cool drop-shadow effect to the search box when you click on it. 

The buttons took awhile - I wanted to add some cool effects when you hover the cursor over it and that meant diving into the dev tools to figure out how Google achieved that effect.
