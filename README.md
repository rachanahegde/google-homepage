<h1> Google Homepage Project </h1>

I did the google homepage project for The Odin Project's Web Dev 101 course. This is the easy version of the project which involves deconstructing an existing web page and rebuilding it. There was a steep learning curve but now I have a better understanding of HTML and CSS. ** Please note: This webpage won't load properly on phones and isn't responsive (I'm still learning!). I designed it for a laptop screen. 

<h2> reflections on the process </h2>

Doing this project forced me to finally figure out how to use the browser's developer tools. These were especially useful when I needed to figure out the exact shade of blue or grey that Google uses and other little things that made the page look more realistic. I also learned how to run Git commands on my laptop and update this repo.

This process involved some trial and error and a lot of googling beginner stuff like "how to make a navbar" or "how to build a form." Figuring out the spacing, padding, margins, and alignment of each element was a lot harder than I anticipated and took a great deal of time to get (somewhat) right. This design also isn't responsive so resizing the browser window sometimes had a weird effect on the spacing of all the elements. 

Building the search bar taught me how to nest divs. I spent a few hours working this out because I had never done this before and it also helped me practice using classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page.

I also learned about box shadows which allowed me to add that cool drop-shadow effect to the search box which is enabled when you click or hover on it.

Lastly, I ran into some issues with the footer until I fixed it at the bottom of the page with a width of 100%. 

Overall, this was an great experience and I feel a little more confident about my skills now. I'm sure there's plenty of other little changes I could make to really perfect this web page but I'm happy with how it turned out and I'm going to move on for now.
